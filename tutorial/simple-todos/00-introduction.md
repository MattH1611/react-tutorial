In this tutorial we will build a simple to-do tasks app using [React](https://reactjs.org) with the Meteor platform. Meteor works out-of-the-box with several other frameworks like [Blaze](https://guide.meteor.com/blaze.html), [Angular](https://guide.meteor.com/angular.html) and [Vue](https://guide.meteor.com/vue.html).
