Meteor React Tutorial is where you learn the basics of Meteor with React.

If you want to know more about Meteor check our [website](https://www.meteor.com)

A few tips before you start:
- If you want to check the final code of each step you can always go to the [`src`](https://github.com/meteor/react-tutorial/tree/master/src) folder.
- Each folder inside [`src`](https://github.com/meteor/react-tutorial/tree/master/src) folder is a tutorial and inside each you have one folder for each step final state. Each step folder is a Meteor app, you can run it if you want.
  - Install it: `meteor npm install`
  - Run it: `meteor`
- When you see `..` in the code samples this means that we are not showing all the code on this file or function.
