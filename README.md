### Running locally

#### Starting hexo

- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js (yes, this is an hexo project and not Meteor, in Meteor you don't need to worry about Node.js versions at all)

  `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`
- Install Node.js 8.11.2:

  `nvm install 8.11.2`
  
- Install the project

  `npm install`

- Run it

  `npm start`
